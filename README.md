# Evented State Processor (ESP) timer Example 

This example demonstrates a simple timer.
It uses both [esp-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esp-js) and [esp-js-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esp-js-react) to build a unidirectional, model first application.

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) or yarn installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`yarn install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`yarn start`

Browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the app.
